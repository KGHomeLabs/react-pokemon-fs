This file describes the overall project outline.

## What is this Project

This project is a homelab. The intent is to create a setup that allows to play around with multiple aspects of a typical SLDC lifecycle. This implies possible multiple subprojects (frontend, backends, build pipelines, Design, Definitions etc.).

This setup will be in constant flux but the overall goal is to have buildable result along the way.

The focus of the projecgs will be to maximize the use of AI while at the same time applying the human experience to try out different architectual approaches and moving things around as required.

-    Use AI
-    Try out and learn languages a bit deepers (thats why sometimes the use of some concept might seem forced)
-    make use of git at every step
-    No pure Vibe-Coding but writing as much code as possible using AI

This shall grow into a set of projects that inclue:

-    A pokemon applications as a browser user interface (current focus)
     . More details: .\react-pokemon-client\aicontext\ReadMe.md
-    A CI CD pipeline with Azure DevOps
-    Hosted cheaply to show deployment works
-    A seperate Webservice in a different language C# WebAPI to support a jfew pokemona application features
-    An phone app that works with the pokemon app
-    AI based UI testing
